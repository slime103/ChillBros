'Freight Train Gangsta' TTF (True Type Font) 
(C)2012 EpicDelusion  Epicdelusion.com
Author: Tom Kolodziejski


'Freight Train Gangsta' TTF is a unique, hand-drawn font; each letter was crafted 
 originally using a marker on sketch paper and uploaded and touched up in Adobe(TM) Photoshop.
 The style and composition of the font reflects that of the underground Graffiti, hip hop, skater, punk & various
 other urban sub-cultures, and it is with great pleasure that I introduce it to the artistic community.
 I want to give special thanks to the mysterious world of unknown and established graffiti artists
 across the globe whose style, dedication, risk, attitude and artfulness give rise to the popularity 
 and appreciation of the art, and inspire people of all walks of life.

Cheers!
